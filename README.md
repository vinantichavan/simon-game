 This game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the user. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases, and if the user failed to press the buttons in that sequence, the game is over.
